# Godot Web Export Template

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/695dd1ff-9c7a-473d-bb5b-a89c5c9a979f/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/godot-web-export-template/deploys)

Automatically deploys your game builds to Web using Netlify.

Uses <https://github.com/abarichello/godot-ci> for CI.

On any push to `main`, a new build will be deployed to Netlify and available at the site URL.

Current Godot version: `4.2.1`

## GitHub setup

Choose `Read and write permissions` for Actions in [Settings â†’ Actions](../../settings/actions).

## Netlify setup

1. Import your GitHub repository to Netlify: <https://app.netlify.com/start>
2. Use the `gh-pages` branch to deploy.
3. Optionally, configure a custom domain (e.g., <https://godot-web-export-template.netlify.app/>): `https://app.netlify.com/sites/<your-site>/configuration/general`
4. Optionally, add a status badge (from the same config page) to [README.md](README.md) (replace the `Netlify Status` above).

## Quick tunnel share

To quickly share your local build (without having to push to GitHub), you can use `cloudflared` to create a tunnel to your local server.

If you're on Windows, you can use WSL to run the commands below.

[Install cloudflared](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/downloads/)
and download [serve.py](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/godotengine/godot/master/platform/web/serve.py) from the Godot repository:

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/godotengine/godot/master/platform/web/serve.py -P build
```

Then, assuming you have a local build in `build/web`, run:

```bash
python build/serve.py -n -r web
```

and in another terminal:

```bash
cloudflared tunnel --url 0.0.0.0:8060
```
